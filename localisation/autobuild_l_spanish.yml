 #Description of mod (link):
 edict_auto_build_2:0 "Auto-Improve Buildings That Cost Influence"

 edict_auto_build_3:0 "Automatic Construction of New Buildings"
 edict_auto_build_3_desc:0 "This edict will automatically make tiles with energy but without slaves build power plants, tiles with minerals build mines and tiles with scientific resources but without slaves build basic laboratories."
 
 edict_auto_build_4:0 "Automatic Slavery"
 edict_auto_build_4_desc:0 "This edict will automatically enslave the population in tiles with mines, farms, planetary capitals, etc. In general, this edict auto-enslaves pops in all the tiles where slaves will profit. Where slaves are not necessary, people will be free."

 edict_auto_build_5:0 "Auto-Improve Laboratories on Good Planets"
 edict_auto_build_5_desc:0 "This edict will automatically improve all the basic laboratories on planets that have a bonus modifier to a specific field of science (for example, Unstable Tectonics) to a laboratory that generates additional research of that type."
 
 edict_auto_build_6:0 "Semi-Random Improving Laboratories"
 edict_auto_build_6_desc:0 "This edict will make all laboratories automatically improve depending on the resource type in the tiles (useful if your population has a trait for a certain kind of science). If the resource is not present, the type of laboratory improvement will be selected at random. If you do not have the Auto-Improve Laboratories on Good Planets edict active, the laboratory will improve randomly even on planets with useful science modifiers."
